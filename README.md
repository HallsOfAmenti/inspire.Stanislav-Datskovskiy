quote: "The enlightened, disciplined mind is the holiest of holies, a wonder among wonders. Upon the Earth - a grain of sand in the Universe, man is on the order of one-billionth of the smallest magnitude... And yet this particle in your mind's eye, that lives but for sixty or so trips of the Earth around the Sun, possesses a mind capable of embracing the whole Universe... To comprehend this, we must switch to the language of higher mathematics... And so, what would you say if someone were to take from your laboratory a precious microscope and start pounding in nails with it?.. Garin has been treating his genius in just such a manner..." â€” Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, "The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin." (Translation and emphasis mine.)
